The first line in the Python file should be a shebang, which specifies which Python interpreter should be used to run your code:

#!/usr/bin/env python
for Python 2
#!/usr/bin/env python3
for Python 3
You can check this reference to understand better what's the shebang and why itâ€™s important:

The code conforms to the PEP8 style recommendations.
You can install the pycodestyle tool to test this, with pip install pycodestyle or pip3 install pycodestyle (Python 3).

In order for this requirement to pass, running the pycodestyle tool on your code should produce zero warnings.

(pycodestyle was formerly known as pep8. These are the same thing.)
