		code	>>>>	query[SQL]		>>>>	database === data on disk
				<<<<	result[table]	<<<<

sudo apt install postgresql-client-common

joined //combine two or more table together

uniqueness and keys
	a column that uniquely identifies the row in a table can be called a primary key.


joining tables (count aggregation)
	select
		TableA.ColumnName1,
		TableA.ColumnName2,
		TableB.ColumnName3
		from TableA join TableB
			on TableA.ColumnName2 =  TableB.ColumnName2
			where ColumnNameX = "some solid value";	// x = 1, 2, 3; attachment
