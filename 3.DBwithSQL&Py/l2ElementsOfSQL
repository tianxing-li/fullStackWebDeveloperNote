-- in sql any line that begins with two dashes is a comment.

select name, birthdate from animals where species = 'gorilla';
	//Every select query in SQL returns a table. 
	//In SQL, the * symbol is a wildcard for columns — it matches all columns in the table.

Types in the sql:
	text - a string of any length, liek py's srt type. values are written in 'signle quotes'.
	integer - like py's int type, but with different limits.
	date - a calendar date. values are written like this: '2014-04-13'.
		//always put 'single quotes' around text strings and date/time values.
			// '2012-11-23' can be a date or text.
			// 2012-11-23 is a integer expression. (2012-11-23=1978)

	Text and string types
		text — a string of any length, like Python str or unicode types.
		char(n) — a string of exactly n characters.
		varchar(n) — a string of up to n characters.

	Numeric types
		integer — an integer value, like Python int.
		real — a floating-point value, like Python float. Accurate up to six decimal places.
		double precision — a higher-precision floating-point value. Accurate up to 15 decimal places.
		decimal — an exact decimal value.

	Date and time types
		date — a calendar date; including year, month, and day.
		time — a time of day.
		timestamp — a date and time together.

select name, birthdate from animals where species = 'gorilla' and(or, not) name = 'Jax';
//keyword			| keywords		| row restriction		| another restriction
	//columns				tables
	not sth = 'aaa'		<==> 	sth != 'aaa'
		attention add the brackets() if needed

Comparison Operators
	= < > <= >= !=

select name from animals 
where species = 'llama' and 
( birthdate >= '1995-01-01') and 
( birthdate <= '1998-12-31');

In SQL there is no way to list tables + coumns in a standard way, each DB has its own code.


create table animals (  
       name text,
       species text,
       birthdate date);

select max(name) from animals;	//that max means the char max, not longest.
select * from animals limit 10;	//limit 10 show the first 10.
select * from animals where species = 'orangutan' order by birthdate (desc);	// order the table by birthdate (desc= reverse order)
select name, birthdate from animals order by name limit 10 offset 2; //offset means begin position
select species, min(birthdate) from animals group by species;	//min from group by
select name, count(*) as num from animals group by name order by num desc;
	//In order to apply having to an aggregated column, you'll want to give it a name using as.

	... limit count
	Return just the first count rows of the result table.
		The limit clause sets a limit on how many rows to return in the result table.

	... limit count offset skip
	Return count rows starting after the first skip rows.

	... order by columns
	... order by columns desc
	Sort the rows using the columns (one or more, separated by commas) as the sort key. Numerical columns will be sorted in numerical order; string columns in alphabetical order. With desc, the order is reversed (desc-ending order).

	... group by columns
	Change the behavior of aggregations such as max, count, and sum. With group by, the aggregation will return one row for each distinct value in columns.

Insert: adding rows
	insert into table ( column1, column2, ... ) values ( val1, val2, ... );

	If the values are in the same order as the table's columns 
	insert into table values ( val1, val2, ... );



select name from animals, diet where animals.species = diet.species and food = 'fish';
select name from animals join diet on animals.species = diet.species where food = 'fish';


After aggregating ==> having
	where is a restriction on the source tables.
	having is a restriction on the result "after aggregation!"
