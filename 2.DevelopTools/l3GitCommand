Git Ignore: ATTENTION: THAT IS A DOC
						//just need to write the file name which should be ignored
	used to tell Git about the files that Git should not track. This file should be placed in the same directory that the .git directory is in.

	If you want to keep a file in your project's directory structure but make sure it isn't accidentally committed to the project, you can use the specially named file, .gitignore (note the dot at the front, it's important!). Add this file to your project in the same directory that the hidden .git directory is located. All you have to do is list the names of files that you want Git to ignore (not track) and it will ignore them.

	blank lines can be used for spacing
	# - marks line as a comment
	* - matches 0 or more characters
	? - matches 1 character
	[abc] - matches a, b, _or_ c
	** - matches nested directories - a/**/z matches
		a/z
		a/b/z
		a/b/c/z

git tag 			// check tags
git tag -a v1.0		// add a tag
git tag -a v1.0 a87984
git tag -a beta b552fa5
git tag -d v1.0		// del a tag
git tag --delete v1.0
		//-a tells Git to create an annotated flag. If you don't provide the flag (i.e. git tag v1.0) then it'll create what's called a lightweight tag.
		//Annotated tags are recommended because they include a lot of extra information such as:
			the person who made the tag
			the date the tag was made
			a message for the tag
