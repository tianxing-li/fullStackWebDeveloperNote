SSH setting up
	hosted option
		use amazon lightsail

	local vm option
		virtualBox
		Vagrant
			create:
				mkdir networking
				cd networking
				vagrant init ubuntu/trusty64
				vagrant up

			open:
				vagrant ssh

Installing networking tools
	sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
		the && in the above command means "run the first program; then if that succeeds, run the second program
	sudo apt-get install netcat-openbsd tcpdump traceroute mtr

ping -c3 8.8.8.8
	-c3 means to send 3 test messages, then quit

printf 'HEAD / HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: en.wikipedia.org\r\n\r\n' | nc en.wikipedia.org 80
	show http header from wiki
	nc -> net cat(handy tool mentally talking to internet services.)
		connecting to a port and sending a string over it
		a thin wrapper over tcp
	| pipe: take the ouput of first part program and feed it in as the input of the later program

man nc 	//netcat manual page
nc -l 8080 	//use nc to listen on port 8080, that is server, cuz it is waiting for a program to connect to that port
nc 127.0.0.1 8080 	//a connection between the ports
	//that is a tcp only connection
	//The connection may be terminated using an EOF (‘^D’ or 'ctrl + D').

printf "GET / HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: www.example.com\r\n\r\n" | nc www.example.com 80
	//do GET requests
printf "GET / HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: www.example.com\r\n\r\n" | nc www.example.com 80 > example.txt
	//save the results to the file example.txt


Port Nr.
	distinguish diff. app. and sessions on the same host.
	//exp. 80 for HTTP, 22 for SSH
	The port range that a normal (non-root) user can listen on is 1024 through 65535. But if you use root access (including sudo) then you can listen on ports down to 1.
	On most sys. the lowesr 1,024 ports from 0 up to 1,023, are reserved for programs that are started by the sys superuser account or root on Unix.

	lsof	//lists open files, including network sockets(listening or connected)
			//-i to list only network sockets
		lsof -i | grep "LISTEN"
