URI for Uniform Resource Identifier, a name for a resource

URL or Uniform Resource Locator, a URL is a URI for a resource on the network
	URL就是用定位的方式实现的URI

URL and URI
	1）URI是个纯粹的句法结构，用于指定标识Web资源的字符串的各个不同部分。URL是URI的一个特例，它包含了定位Web资源的足够信息
	URI 是统一资源标识符，而 URL 是统一资源定位符。因此，笼统地说，每个 URL 都是 URI，但不一定每个 URI 都是 URL。这是因为 URI 还包括一个子类，即统一资源名称 (URN)，它命名资源但不指定如何定位资源。mailto、news 和 isbn URI 都是 URN 的示例
	mailto：cay@horstman.com

https is the scheme;
en.wikipedia.org is the hostname;
and /wiki/Fish is the path.

<a href="cliffsofinsanity.png">cliffsofinsanity.png</a> is a relative URI reference. 

host google.com	//look up hostnames in DNS(Domain Name Service)
nslookup google.com

Localhost is 127.0.0.1. Well, that's IPv4 localhost, anyway. IPv6 localhost is ::1, which is short for 0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0001.
0.0.0.0 is not a regular IP address. Instead, it's a special code for "every IPv4 address on this computer".

HTTP URIs imply a port number of 80, whereas HTTPS URIs imply a port number of 443.


Http GET Request
127.0.0.1 - - [03/Oct/2016 15:45:50] "GET /readme.png HTTP/1.1" 200 -
	GET /readme.png HTTP/1.1
		GET is the method or HTTP verb being used, clients use when they want a server to send a resource
		/readme.png is the path of the resource being requested
		HTTP/1.1 is the protocol of the request


ncat 127.0.0.1 8000	//connect your terminal to the demo server.
GET / HTTP/1.1		//typing
Host: localhost

HTTP response

	status line
		HTTP/1.0 200 OK
		HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
			status codes
			1xx — Informational. The request is in progress or there's another step to take.
			2xx — Success! The request succeeded. The server is sending the data the client asked for.
			3xx — Redirection. The server is telling the client a different URI it should redirect to. The headers will usually contain a Location header with the updated URI. Different codes tell the client whether a redirect is permanent or temporary.
			4xx — Client error. The server didn't understand the client's request, or can't or won't fill it. Different codes tell the client whether it was a bad URI, a permissions problem, or another sort of error.
			5xx — Server error. Something went wrong on the server side.

	headers	//An HTTP response can include many headers. Headers aren't displayed by browsers or other clients; instead, they tell the client various information about the response.
		Location
		Content-type: //e.g: text/html; charset=utf-8 or image/png
		Set-Cookie	//set a cookie, the browser will then send the cookie data back in a Cookie header on subsequent requests
		Content-Length	//Browsers use this so they can fetch multiple pieces of data (such as images on a web page) without having to reconnect to the server.

that means, man could use this service to pretend to a server(mail server for example) to send trash, even though he is not a server.
